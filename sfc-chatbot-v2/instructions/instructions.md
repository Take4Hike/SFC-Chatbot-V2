#### Example: `lib/utils.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Formats a given date to a readable string.
 * @param date - The date to format.
 * @returns A formatted date string.
 */
export const formatDate = (date: Date): string => {
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
  });
};

Example: components/index.tsx

import React from 'react';

/**
 * Button Component
 * @param props - Properties including onClick and children.
 * @returns A styled button element.
 */
const Button: React.FC<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>> = ({
  children,
  ...props
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600"
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;

Example Responses
Provide example responses or outputs where applicable to clarify expected behaviors.

Example: API Response Structure

If the project includes API routes, outline the expected request and response formats.


// GET /api/user
{
  "id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

Development Guidelines

Coding Standards
TypeScript: Use strict type definitions for all components and functions.
React: Functional components with hooks.
Styling: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
File Naming: Use kebab-case for filenames and PascalCase for React components.
Version Control
Branching Strategy: Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
Commit Messages: Follow conventional commit messages for clarity.
Pull Requests: Require code reviews before merging to the main branch.
Testing
Basic Testing: Implement basic tests to ensure components render correctly.
Linting: Use ESLint to maintain code quality.
Formatting: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Assumptions

Developers are familiar with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The project does not require authentication or database integrations at this stage.
Future expansions may include additional features and integrations as needed.
Constraints

Minimalistic Approach: The project must adhere to a minimal file structure, limiting the number of files and directories.
Technology Stack: Must use Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS without introducing additional frameworks or libraries unless necessary.
Documentation: All necessary information must be included within the README and inline comments, avoiding external documentation files.
